# IT Assisting Scripts
ITAssistingScripts is a collection of automation scripts aimed at simplifying and securing the day-to-day operations of IT professionals, particularly those working in Managed Service Providers (MSPs). These scripts assist with the configuration, auditing, and management of various platforms, such as Microsoft 365, Cloudflare, and more services that may be supported in the future.

The goal is to reduce human error, speed up routine tasks, and enforce best practices in security across commonly used services.

# üîê Security Notice
Security is a top priority in this project. While contributors strive to follow secure coding practices, we strongly encourage all users to review any script before running it in a production environment.

## ‚ö† If you encounter:
- Obfuscated code
- Suspicious or unexplained string concatenations for URL generation
- External HTTP requests that seem out of scope
- File or data manipulation that isn't clearly documented
*Please open an issue immediately or submit a pull request with your concerns.*

This project is built with transparency in mind, and the community is critical in maintaining its trustworthiness.

# üìå Why This Project Exists
As an IT professional working for an MSP (Managed Service Provider), I‚Äôve seen firsthand how often critical security configurations are overlooked‚Äîespecially in Microsoft 365 environments and mail systems. These oversights can lead to serious vulnerabilities and breaches.

With a strong background in cybersecurity, I take a **"security first, cost second"** approach to IT management. While businesses understandably focus on profitability, I believe that automation, secure defaults and standardisation can bridge the gap between efficiency and responsible security practices‚Äîwithout inflating operational costs.

This project aims to share that mindset with others, helping IT professionals:
- Reduce misconfigurations
- Automate best practices
- Identify and mitigate risks early
